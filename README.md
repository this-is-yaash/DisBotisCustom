# User Command Limitation Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the implementation of user command limitations for certain commands like kick, ban, and unban in a Discord bot. These limitations are set to control access to specific actions based on the user's role.

## Implementation

### Access Control
1. Create an access.js Module:

Create a module named access.js that checks the user's role before allowing certain commands.

```javascript
// access.js
module.exports = {
  checkPermission: async (interaction, requiredRole) => {
    // Implement logic to check the user's role
    const member = interaction.guild.members.cache.get(interaction.user.id);
    if (member.roles.cache.some(role => role.name === requiredRole)) {
      return true;
    } else {
      await interaction.reply('You do not have permission to execute this command.');
      return false;
    }
  },
};
```

2. Use access.js in Command Files:

In your command files (e.g., kick.js, ban.js, unban.js), use the checkPermission function from access.js to control access.

```javascript
// kick.js
const access = require('./access.js');

module.exports = {
  data: // ... (SlashCommandBuilder),
  async execute(interaction) {
    const requiredRole = 'Admin'; // Replace with the name of the role you want to check

    // Check permissions
    if (!(await access.checkPermission(interaction, requiredRole))) {
      return;
    }

    // Rest of the kick command logic
    // ...
  },
};
```

## Command Limitation

- Apply to Other Commands

Repeat the process for other commands like ban and unban. Adjust the `requiredRole` accordingly.

## Usage
1. Ensure the access.js module is properly implemented.
2. Include access.js in each command file where you want to limit access.
3. Set the appropriate requiredRole for each command.

Now, only users with the specified role will be able to execute commands like `kick`, `ban`, and `unban`.

Feel free to customize the `access.js` module and command files based on your specific requirements and roles.
