## Kick Command

### Command Syntax


### Description

The `kick` command allows you to kick a user from the server.

### Usage

1. Type `/kick @user` in the server chat, where `@user` is the user you want to kick.
2. The bot will attempt to kick the specified user.

### Example


## Ban Command

### Command Syntax


### Description

The `ban` command allows you to ban a user from the server.

### Usage

1. Type `/ban @user` in the server chat, where `@user` is the user you want to ban.

### Example


## Unban Command

### Command Syntax


### Description

The `unban` command allows you to unban a user from the server.

### Usage

1. Type `/unban User_ID` in the server chat, where `User_ID` is the unique ID of the user you want to unban.
